                <h3>Monday, January 3</h3>
                <p>Drove from Dasmarinas to Subic Bay. The drive was really scenic, the highway roads were new, and there weren't many cars on the road. When we go to the condotel, we realized our front left tire was flat. We unpacked the car, unpacked our things in the condotel, replaced the flat tire with a spare, went grocery shopping, did laundry, and cooked dinner. We made an build your own korean kimbap handrolls board - it was delicious!</p>

                <h3>Tuesday, Jaunary 4</h3>
                <p>Went to New Subic Public Market to get groceries. The market was big, clean, and not too crowded. Was a pleasant market experience. Got lunch at 2 and 2 on the way back to Chequere Suites. Had bulalo and mang shakes on the beach. Before dinner, we took a walk to the beach and explored the duty free supermarket. Had leftover bulalo for dinner and paired it with a crab meat salad.</p>

                <h3>Thursday, January 5</h3>
                <p>Went to Pamulaklakin Trail this morning and had a mini jungle tour with Anthony. Learned about trees/plants that help with kidney stones and UTIS, (goo goo) soap/shampoo, water source, and a healing ointment. Had a nice breakfast in the river with oatmeal and bananas brought from the condotel. Walked to the mall to find pastries and stumbled upon Red Ribbon and picked out ensymada. Went to the grocery store at the mall to get ingredients for dinner - penne, tomato sauce, meatless meatballs, and broccoli.</p>
